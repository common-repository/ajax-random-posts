Displays a list of random posts using AJAX. Works with cache plugins, and highly customizable.

== Description ==
This plugins display a highly customizable list of random posts. There are some plugins that serve a similar purpose already, with one drawback: If they're used along with cache plugins (like WP-Super Cache), the list is cached also, and remains the same over thousands of views, thus not so "random." AJAX Random Posts, as its name says, uses AJAX to retrieve the posts and overcome the problem: now each page refresh comes with a different list!

== Features ==
* Compatible with caching plugins, since the core is written and run in JavaScript which is normally not cached.
* The list is highly customizable: number of posts, html format, tags (like post url, title, categories, date etc.) can be included.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin
1. Extract into a folder
1. Upload the entire to `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
1. Enable it via Plugins panel
1. It should now work out of the box. If you want to tweak a bit, head to Settings->AJAX Random Posts
